      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not immediately obvious how to check if a string is a valid prefix of another in C, given the lack of high-level string manipulation tools. Below explains how this can be done.
Checking the prefix For this function we&amp;rsquo;ll use strncmp which accepts two strings and the maximum number of characters to compare, and returns an int. If the return value is equal to 0, the strings are equal. We can leverage this by checking the size of the prefix string, and calling strncmp using that size.</description>

      <description>Writing to a CSV using C code A basic CSV file relies on a comma-separated data format, which makes it straightforward to write to this file type from a c program.
First you will want to create a file pointer, which will be used to access and write to a file. Then we call fopen on this file pointer, passing in the name of the file we want to write to.</description>
