      <description>For this tutorial I will be assuming you have already setup a site on Github Pages that&amp;rsquo;s being run on the standard USERNAME.github.io domain. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so, a quick Google search will yield lots of articles explaining the process. I&amp;rsquo;m using Bluehost as my domain provider, but the steps should be similar for any major domain provider.
Setup in Github repository In your Github repo for the site, navigate to the &amp;ldquo;Settings&amp;rdquo; tab.</description>

      <title>Why I&#39;m moving from Wordpress to Hugo</title>

      <description>Why move from Wordpress to Hugo? I created a Wordpress site on Bluehost for my personal/blog site because I thought it would be the easiest way to publish blogs without having to worry about hosting or creating my own site. Even as a developer, I have no interest in spending too much time reinventing the wheel to create a simple blog. After writing just one entry there, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with the solution.</description>

      <title>Generating Sales from YouTube micro-influencers</title>

      <description>For the last few months, I’ve been reaching out to “micro influencers” on YouTube, with the hope of driving targeted traffic to my product, http://discordbotstudio.org. I’m classifying micro influencers as having between 1,000 – 10,000 subscribers on YouTube. The benefit of reaching channels of this size is that they have dedicated audiences based on a certain niche (in my case this is Discord Bots and the creation thereof).
Background Info Discord Bot Studio (DBS) is a visual programming tool I released on Steam on May 12th, 2020 (2 months prior to writing this).</description>
